                        <p>Neck and Legs: Despite their long necks, giraffes actually have the same number of neck vertebrae as humans-seven! <br>
                            However, each vertebra is much longer. Their legs are also incredibly long, with each leg measuring about 6 feet (1.8 meters).</p>

                        <p>Savannas are not purely grasslands or forests; they are a mixture of both.<br>
                            The landscape is characterized by vast stretches of grass with some scattered trees and shrubs,<br>
                            typically acacias or baobabs, which are adapted to the dry conditions.</p>

                        <p>Lions have one of the most powerful roars in the animal kingdom.<br>
                            Their roars can be heard from up to 5 miles (8 kilometers) away and serve to communicate with other lions,<br>
                            establish territory, and warn off potential threats. A lion's roar can reach up to 114 decibels, which is louder than a chainsaw.</p>

                        <p>Elephants communicate through a wide range of sounds, some of which are infrasonic (below the human hearing range).<br>
                           These low-frequency rumbles can travel over long distances, allowing elephants to communicate with each other even if they are miles apart.<br>
                           They also use body language, such as ear movements, trunk gestures, and even their sense of smell to express themselves.</p>
